To put only the updated file `phase1/Gemini_CLI_setup.md` into your `phase1-complete-branch` without including other changes from the `main` branch, you can follow these steps. This process involves staging a specific file, committing it, and then pushing it to your desired branch.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

**Scenario: The change is already committed to the `main` branch.**

If the update to `phase1/Gemini_CLI_setup.md` is already part of a commit in the `main` branch, you can "cherry-pick" that specific file change.

1.  **Find the commit hash:**
    First, you need to identify the specific commit in the `main` branch that contains the changes to the file you want.
    ```bash
    git log main -- phase1/Gemini_CLI_setup.md
    ```
    Copy the commit hash (the long string of letters and numbers).

2.  **Switch to your target branch:**
    Move to the branch where you want to apply the change.
    ```bash
    git checkout phase1-complete-branch
    ```

3.  **Cherry-pick the file from the commit:**
    Use the `git checkout` command with the commit hash and the file path. This will bring the version of the file from that specific commit into your current branch's working directory.
    ```bash
    git checkout <commit-hash> -- phase1/Gemini_CLI_setup.md
    ```
    Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual commit hash you copied.

4.  **Stage the file:**
    Add the cherry-picked file to the staging area.
    ```bash
    git add phase1/Gemini_CLI_setup.md
    ```

5.  **Commit the change:**
    Create a new commit on your `phase1-complete-branch` for this file.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Cherry-pick Gemini_CLI_setup.md update from main"
    ```

6.  **Push the commit:**
    Push the new commit to your remote branch.
    ```bash
    git push origin phase1-complete-branch
    ```

# Switching back to the `main` branch in Git

### Using `git switch` (Recommended) 

To switch to the `main` branch, simply run: 

```bash
git switch main
``` 

### Handling Uncommitted Changes 
If you have uncommitted changes in your current branch that would be overwritten by switching to main, Git will prevent the switch. You have a few options in this scenario:

1.  **Commit the changes:** If the changes are complete, commit them to your current branch before switching. 
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ``` 

2.  **Stash the changes:** If you're not ready to commit, you can temporarily store your changes using `git stash`. 
    ```bash
    git stash
    ``` 
    After switching to `main`, you can reapply these changes later with `git stash pop`. 

3.  **Discard the changes:** If you don't want to keep the changes, you can discard them. With `git switch`, you can use the `--discard-changes` flag: 
    ```bash
    git switch main --discard-changes
    ``` 
    With `git checkout`, you would typically reset the files first: 
    ```bash
    git checkout .
    ``` 

### Updating Your Local `main` Branch 

After switching to the `main` branch, it's a good practice to ensure it's up-to-date with the remote repository. You can do this by running: 

```bash
git pull origin main
``` 

This command fetches the latest changes from the `main` branch on the `origin` remote and merges them into your local `main` branch.
