# ðŸš€ My Hands-On LLM Learning Journey

This repository tracks my hands-on learning with Python, GitHub, WSL, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Each phase is a self-contained learning project.

## ðŸ§­ Phases

### âœ… [Phase 0](./phase0/)
> *Goal:* Set up environment (WSL + Python + PyTorch GPU) and validate setup.

### ðŸ”œ Phase 1: Prompt Engineering
> *Goal:* Learn prompt design, tokenization, temperature, and logit bias in OpenAI/transformer models.

(â€¦and more to come)

## ðŸ“Œ Why This Exists

Iâ€™m using this repo to document and demonstrate my growth, hands-on experiments, and working knowledge in applied AI development â€” from the system layer to LLM interaction techniques.
